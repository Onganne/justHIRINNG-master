      <p>Deciding on an organization's automations or AI integrations requires great planning and preparation, which needs info from the company comes first in the planning, including the product, business theme, and budget.
      </p>
      <p>One must conduct research and identification to determine how to begin with making the info as effective as possible. 
      </p>
      <p>To go into more depth on analyzing the market, research on how the company operates, how the market operates, and how the product is classified are now specific and can change how one operates their products. For example, if a company has a complex operation of multiple aspects, then a more complex system is required.
      </p>
      <p>Deciding the AI system and focus of the automation comes next. After all the research, there will most likely have a variety of option to how we will make the system and customize it for a specific purpose. Price varies depending on what the client wants from the staff.
      </p>
      <p>The overall personalized and customized system will be determined by what information we are able to feed it to the database, which determines how it reacts to attract more consumers. This will also determine brand style and reputation.
      </p>
      <p>The finalizing phase begins. To make sure no mistakes are made, checking the info and comparing it to the data gathered is a requirement in the AI industry. The removal of excess info and filler content to filter out for more effective system will be done after.</p>
      <p> Include other clients and staffs perspective from consultations and opinions.</p>
      <p>The process of making the automations and AI finally begins. This may take four weeks to even a month depending on the amount of criterias needed. </p>
      <p>Before providing the service and product to the client, checks are made ont only by rechecking all content and comparing it to the data, but also by letting other departments check to ensure no bias (including the Director). The client can also ask for revisions if really needed, but only for valid reasons will it be free of charge.</p>
      <p>If revisions are to be made, a valid reason must be presented as well as an outline of the needed changes. Invalid excuses include but are not limited to: Misplaced info, change of market, change of theme, and change of form as these should have been finalized already. Payment could be made for revisions still.
